# synchrony_analysis

This project focuses on analyzing neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice, recorded using a two-photon holographic mesoscope. The primary goal is to investigate if the neuronal population activity, whether stimulated synchronously or asynchronously, aligns with the "like-to-like" connectivity theory, which posits that neurons with similar functional properties are more likely to be interconnected.

Data Preprocessing: 
Import and preprocess mesoscopic recordings to isolate neuronal signals.

Stimulation Analysis: 
Identify and categorize neuron groups based on synchronous and asynchronous stimulation.
Quantify activity levels and interaction strength across neuron populations.

Connectivity Analysis:
Apply statistical models and correlation analyses to assess if neuronal connectivity patterns align with the "like-to-like" connectivity hypothesis.
Visualize connectivity maps and activity correlations among similar and dissimilar neuronal populations.

Libraries: Scientific computing and visualization libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib for Python, or equivalent in MATLAB)
